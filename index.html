<h1>Chupa Stuff</h1>
<p>The chupacabra or chupacabras (literally meaning 'goat-sucker' from the Spanish word chupar, 'to suck', and cabras, 'goats') is a legendary creature in the folklore of parts of the Americas, with its first purported sightings reported in Puerto Rico in 1995. The name comes from the animal's reported vampirismâ€”the chupacabra is said to attack and drink the blood of livestock, including goats.</p>
